## PCAP Data extractor for docker
This repository contains source codes for my thesis project, which is using PCAP-library to capture and extract data from given interface inside docker container. This data can then be used to work on various things like monitoring traffic between different IP-endpoints, the type of traffic like UDP/TCP, the possibilities are virtually endless.

Index file contains a simple example demonstration of just logging the different data structures into console.

## Potential future additions (outside of the thesis context)
- Support for higher layers of OSI-stack
- Support for layer 1 ethernet packets
- Decoding more data, like IPv4 packet header options
